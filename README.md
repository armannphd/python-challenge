# python-challenge


# Within this 'python-challenge' folder, there is a 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' folder, and  this README file

# Within either the 'PyBank' or 'PyPoll' folder, there is an 'analysis' folder, a 'resources' folder, and a file named 'main.py'

# The 'main.py' file, when run in either 'PyBank' or 'PyPoll' should yield an analysis of the csv files within the 'resources' folder.  Additionally, in each 'analysis' folder, the results should be saved as a new txt file.  

# Within the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyBank' folder, there should be a file named 'PyBank_Output.txt' once the code in the 'main.py' is run.

# Within the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyPoll' folder, there should be a file named 'PyPoll_Output.txt' once the code in the 'main.py' is run.
