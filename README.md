# Within this 'python-challenge' folder, there is a 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' folder, and  this README file

# Within either the 'PyBank' or 'PyPoll' folder, there is an 'analysis' folder, a 'resources' folder, and a file named 'main.py'

# The 'main.py' file, when run in either 'PyBank' or 'PyPoll' should yield an analysis of the csv file within the 'resources' folder 'PyBank' folder contains 'budget_data.csv' inside of its 'resources' folder and 'PyPoll' contains 'election_data.csv' inside of its 'resources' folder.  Additionally, in each 'analysis' folder, the results should be saved as a new txt file once the 'main.py' file is run.  

# Within the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyBank' folder, there should be a file named 'PyBank_Output.txt' once the code in the 'main.py' is run.

# Within the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyPoll' folder, there should be a file named 'PyPoll_Output.txt' once the code in the 'main.py' is run.
